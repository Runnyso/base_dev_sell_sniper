# Base — Dev Sell Sniper

This is the nuclear button.

It does one thing:  
the **second** the dev wallet sells — even 1 token —  
your terminal screams.

No waiting for LP removal.  
No waiting for honeypot.  
No waiting for tax changes.

Just pure, instant betrayal detection.

## How it works
1. Catches every new Base pool
2. Extracts the exact wallet that created it
3. Watches that wallet 24/7
4. The moment it sells → **YOU ARE FIRST TO KNOW**

## Run

```bash
python base_dev_sell_sniper.py
